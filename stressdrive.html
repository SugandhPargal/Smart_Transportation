	<h2>About</h2>
	<h2><p>The growth in the market for cab companies like Uber has opened the door to high-income options for drivers. However, in order to boost their income, drivers many a time resort to accepting trips which increases their stress resulting in poor driving quality and accidents in serious cases. Every driver handles stress differently and the trip recommendation thus needs to be on a personalized level. to deal with this, we developed a recommendation system, which is based on the driver’s personality traits, predicts if a new trip will lead to stress resulting in dangerous driving behavior and recommends if the driver should Accept/Reject the trip<p></h2>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><b>Developed a model to compute stress taking into account a driver’s personality traits</b></li>
		<li><b>Quantified dangerous driving behavior</b></li>
		<li><b>Developed a model to predict driving behavior from stress</b></li>
		<li><b>Recommends the driver to Accept or Reject a trip</b></li>
    </ul>
	<br>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h2><p>The developed trip recommendation system (an Android application based on smartphones) is shared with the 7 drivers of the in-house cab company and recorded the results for a week. Whenever a ride was sent to a driver, the ride details were fed to the system. The recommendation system decided whether the driver should take a ride or skip and the information is flashed on the driver’s phone.</p></h2>
